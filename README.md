# PyTorch Basics

Welcome, the purpose of this repo is to help you get familiar with PyTorch. I'll be summarizing and providing steps based on the PDF book Dr. Pengo provided to help you start using PyTorch effectively.

## Prerequisites

### Cloud IDE Users

If you're using a cloud IDE, please check the Python version to ensure it is up to date. PyTorch requires Python 3.7 or above.

### Local Development Setup

For those setting up your environment locally, I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) since this project is developed using VSCode.

#### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
2. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

#### Step 2: Install Python

1. Download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and ensure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python --version`. You should see the installed version of Python.

## Installing PyTorch

To install the latest version of PyTorch, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install PyTorch and torchvision:
   * pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
