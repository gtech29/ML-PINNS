# Solving Physics Equations with Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to our team's efforts to explore and develop methods for solving complex physics equations using neural networks. Here, we will:

- Post our research findings
- Share code, data, and other resources
- Collaborate on different aspects of the project

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/docs**: Documentation and research papers
- **/src**: Source code for our experiments and models
- **/data**: Datasets used for training and evaluation
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and prototyping
- **/results**: Output results from our experiments
- **/scripts**: Utility scripts for data processing and other tasks
