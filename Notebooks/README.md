# Notebooks Repository

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks for different projects and purposes. Follow the instructions below to get Jupyter installed locally and running on your computer.

## Installation Instructions

Jupyter's tools are available for installation via the Python Package Index. This page uses instructions with pip, the recommended installation tool for Python. If you require environment management as opposed to just installation, look into conda, mamba, pipenv, and Homebrew.

### JupyterLab

Install JupyterLab with pip:

```sh
pip install jupyterlab
```

To run JupyterLab after installation, execute the following command:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

### Jupyter Notebook

Install the classic Jupyter Notebook with:

```
pip install notebook
```

To run Jupyter Notebook after installation, execute the following command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook will launch in your default web browser. From there, you can create new notebooks, open existing ones, and start coding.

Note: If you encounter any issues during the installation or running process, ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that your Python environment is set up correctly.
